crtsh
=====
Go tool for getting subdomains from crt.sh.
This is a Golang port from a Python script at https://github.com/YashGoti/crtsh.
I wanted something that was a little easier to install and extend.
Since Go makes it very easy to install binaries without need for virtual env's this was a good use case for Golang.


## Install
Just use `go install`.

```shell
$ go install github.com/soerlemans/crtsh@latest
```
